# pythontryouts
This is my first attempt at making a small app.
Also first time making something in Python.

The purpose of the app is to find the ideal moment to make use of your solar panels.
My assumption is that it is best to immediately use energy,
instead of converting it back and forth to send back it to the grid.

You input the amount of hours you expect to using the energy, 
enter your latitude and longitude (use google maps),
and lastly enter your weatherapi.com API key (not gonna share my own here of course, it's free so you can create your own key).

Feedback is welcome.

It is a work in progress, still on the to do list:
- Ability to enter expected power use
- Ability to enter estimated power production
- Improve GUI (perhaps using other tools)
